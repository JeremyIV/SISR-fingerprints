ðŸ‘· **These instructions are under construction. Check back soon for our dataset and full instructions on how to reproduce the experients in our paper.** 

This is the official implementation of our TMLR paper [fingerprints of super resolution networks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Jj0qSbtwdb).

## Installation

### Requirements
Requriements are the same as for [BasicSR](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/BasicSR):

 * Python >= 3.7
 * PyTorch >= 1.7
 * NVIDIA GPU + CUDA
 * Linux (we have not tested on Windows)

### Setup

Clone this Github repo and install the Python package requirements.
    
```bash
git clone git@github.com:JeremyIV/SISR-fingerprints.git
cd SISR-fingerprints
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
