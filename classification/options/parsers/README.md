# Model Parsing Classifier Configs

This directory contains configs for all the models referenced in Section 4.2 (Model Parsing). Because these configs are so numerous and redundant, they are mostly generated by a script:

```bash
python classification/options/parsers/make_parser_options.py
```
These are the parsers that are used in Table 5.

The remaining parsers in this directory are those used in Figure 7. They are the configs which don't have `withholding` in the name.
